# AR.Drone playground

AR.Drone sample flight in Ruby. Coded using the Artoo adaptor for the AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter.

I've been using this boilerplate code as a tool to show how programming can be fun, specially to kids.

Cloning the repo and typing `ruby fly.rb` is everything you need to make the drone fly.

Happy hacking! ;)
