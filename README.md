# AR.Drone playground

Gets AR.Drone 2.0 flying programmatically, with a sample flight coded in Ruby.

It uses the [Artoo](https://github.com/hybridgroup/artoo) Adaptor for the AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter, which leverages Jim Weirich's [Argus](https://github.com/jimweirich/argus).

I've been using this boilerplate code as a tool to show how programming can be fun, specially to kids and teenagers.

## 'Plug & fly'

```
git clone git@github.com:dcarral/ardrone_playground.git
cd ardrone_playground && bundle install

ruby fly.rb
```

Happy hacking! ;)
