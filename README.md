# AR.Drone playground

AR.Drone sample flight coded in Ruby, using the Artoo adaptor for the AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter.

I've been using this boilerplate code as a tool to show how programming can be fun, specially to kids.

## 'Plug & fly'

`git clone https://github.com/dcarral/ardrone_playground.git`

`cd ardrone_playground && bundle install`

`ruby fly.rb`

Happy hacking! ;)
